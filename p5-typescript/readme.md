# Typescript with P5

Make sure you have installed typescript globally with `npm install typescript -g`. This folder already contains type information for P5 in the `@Types` folder. You can also install it with `npm install @types/p5`.

## Compiling

All your `.ts` files will be compiled into a single `.js` file by running `tsc -w` in the terminal, or in VS Code, you can press **CMD+SHIFT+B** and choose **Watch Mode**
