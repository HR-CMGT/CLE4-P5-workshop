# Typescript with P5

## Installing

Make sure you have installed typescript globally with `npm install typescript -g`. This folder already contains type information for P5 in the `@Types` folder. You can also install it with `npm install @types/p5`.

Clone this repository for an example project with Typescript classes.

## Building

Your `.ts` files will be in the `dev` folder. The website (`index.html`, `styles.css`) will be in the `docs` folder.

Compile your typescript into a single `.js` file by running `tsc -w` in the terminal, or in VS Code, you can press **CMD+SHIFT+B** and choose **Watch Mode**
